# IFIP Working Group 2.13 on Open Source Software

This [IFIP][IFIP] Working Group, established in 2006, enables a diverse
community of researchers and practitioners to rigorously investigate the
technology, work practices, development processes, community dynamics within
free, libre and open source software (OSS) systems, complementing appropriately
other IFIP Working Groups where OSS is increasingly relevant.

## Scope

**Software Engineering Perspective:**

- OSS architecture, configuration and release management, environments.
- Testing and assuring OSS quality and security.
- Mining and analyzing OSS project repositories.
- Lessons from OSS for conventional development.
- OSS and standards.

**Studies of OSS Deployment:**

- Case studies of OSS deployment, migration models, success and failure.
- Role of OSS in the public sector (government, education, health etc) and 'secondary' software sector (automotive, telco, medical devices, etc.).
- OSS-compatible IT governance architectures.
- Open sourcing - offshore sourcing of development.
- OSS applications catalog (functionality, platforms, support providers, training needs).
