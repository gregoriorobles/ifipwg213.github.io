Layout overrides goes here.

For example, with the currently used theme
([minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)), layouts are taken by default from
its [_layouts](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/tree/master/_layouts)
directory. But they can be copied and then modified in this directory to
override them.

New layouts can also be added here.
